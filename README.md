# AI Image Generator

This project is a simple web application that utilizes the OpenAI API to generate images based on user-provided text descriptions. Users can describe what they want to see, and the application will return a generated image based on that description.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Real-time image generation using the OpenAI API.
- Default image display while loading new images.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (preferably version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)

## Usage
